# Introduction

Welcome to the Wootric API documentation!

You can use our API to access your end users, responses, declines and page views.

JSON will be returned in all responses from the API including errors. We currently have code examples using curl, you can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `meowmeowmeow` with your personal API key.
